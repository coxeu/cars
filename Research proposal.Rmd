## Methods

## Research Design/Plan

This research proposal aims to design and support AR collaborative learning experiences for middle-school students that engages them in the crosscutting concept of scale across different science domains. This project will employ a design-based research approach (dbr cite), which includes an iterative cycle of design, development, testing and refinement with input from instructors and students. Researchers and instructors will also iterate on supportive materials for teachers to best foster science discussion in the classroom using our learning technology (AR science activity).

As a secondary design principle, we will iterate on the design of this application using the Learning through Embodied Activity Framework (LEAF)\[\@danishLearningEmbodiedActivity2020\] to guide our science learning activity design. LEAF framework provides researchers educators tools for designing mixed reality learning experience, by looking at the roles of the student, teacher and collective groups within the activity itself. These better grounds an embodied activity in the requisite learning goals for instructors and learners, while also highlighting different dimensions of an embodied activity (eg., individual and collective experiences for students and instructors)

## Broad Research Questions:

How can an AR learning environment support students in progressing in their understanding of objects and scientific phenomena at the extreme ends of scales?

-   In what ways do limited AR immersed environments support an embodied learning approach to instruction?\
-   What challenges teacher might face when implementing embodied AR activities in a science classroom?

\### notes

\*\*informal after school technologies\-- can talk with robb\-\--

\*\*after school is an different entitiy\
\*\*teachers dont know what students are doing

Compensating young learners -\> vs the ones that are stuck.

pre/post test \--\> interviews

information from that -\> revisions (earlier prototype schedules)\]\
wont have much information about classroom/facilitation

what are students learning/engaging/small groups (pairs vs groups of 3)\-\-- more student focused(more clarity)

Debrief (focus group interviews)\

they go home (review video tape)\
How are we going to video tape groups?

## Target Group

The target group for this project is middle school students and instructors i

## Project Plan and Timeline

This research proposal will develop a set of AR science activities around the concept of scale across different domains of science (Astronomy and Biology) that will be helpful to middle school learners connect this crosscutting concept to different concepts and situations. The foundation for these AR activities will be around two Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) performance expectations and the LEAF framework.

NGSS Scale performance Expectations:

● \[MS-PS1-1\](https://www.nextgenscience.org/pe/ms-ps1-1-matter-and-its-interactions): Develop models to describe the atomic composition of simple molecules and extended structures.

● \[MS-ESS1-3\](https://www.nextgenscience.org/pe/ms-ess1-3-earths-place-universe): Analyze and interpret data to determine scale properties of objects in the solar system.

Aligning to the above NGSS performance expectations will increase the likelihood that teachers will eventually be able to easily integrate the activities into their normal curricular materials and plans.

###Data Collection

Data will be collected using telemetry (log data) from the mobile application (iPad Pros); Virtual notebooks to create and project annotations; Semi-structured interviews at conclusion of each activity ; Field notes; Audi & video will be recording using GoPro cameras.

We will transcode video recordings alongside the field notes and structured interviews to create a qualitative code scheme (e.g., student engagement, ease of app use, learning gains from activity) and additional log data.\
\### Types of data \#### Interviews

To better understand the affordances of AR on science learning, we will conduct semi-structured interviews with all students to probe what aspect of the augmented learning activity helped them grasp the concept of scale. We pose a few questions:

#### Field Notes

Within our AR application, students will have access to a virtual notebook to make collaborative observations and inferences about different artifacts in their virtual environment. Students will be able to project these annotations and objects on a shared physical space, where students and instructors can make public comments and additional observations.

#### Lesson plans

We will be creating lesson plans...

### Iterative Design Feedback

at least three sessions?\
\## DBR

----pick popular curriculu and see what they're doing -- loooking at local schools

convince teachers to do this-- and match timeline with the curriculum? --Ping rob with this on curriculum; After school (Could do work at the crc?)\
Whats going to happen with covid?

Labels/Designs etc; annotations\
Pre/post test

## Analysis

Researchers will be analyzing field notes, semi structured\
interviews, virtual notebooks, and video data (within IRB appointed gridlines on recording).\
Looking at student learning, the analysis will consist of qualitative coding of observations of student interactions during class as well as input from the teacher interviews. We will code the classroom data for evidence of student learning of the target science core ideas, practices, and crosscutting concepts. We will also code the data for information about how students interacted with the AR application itself and challenges the teachers might have had with managing this newer technology.

## Procedure

two science activities? How long?\
What are they doing? What are the students/teachers doing?\
Teacher more of a facilitator?

after school-

### Hypothesis

A few of the learning hypotheses we are looking at in this research proposal are 1. How do students in a collaborative group interact within a given science activity; and how do they reconcile with scale differences within our app?

### Learning Outcomes

Students will be able to (better?)? developmental models at the extremes of scale across the topics of simple molecules, extended structures, and understand scale properties of objects in the solar system.

## Dissemination plan

##IRB \### Recruitment starategy

Students and instructors will be recruited from a local middle school in the Midwest, with a total of 40 students ranging from grade 5-8th. We will be recruiting up to four instructors to help in lesson plan development and AR activity implementation. Instructors will be compensated 100 dollars each.

#### Excusion criteria --\> something that needs to be done

BVI? what will work for most students?

can be an additional thing? What types of things might be included to be more inclusive?
