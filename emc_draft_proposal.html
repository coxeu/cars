<p>## Theories informing research into AR for learning Relevant learning science theories that will inform my research in the intersection of Augmented Reality (AR) &amp; learning sciences will be embodied learning. Learning embodiment is important in leveraging existing AR affordances previously discussed such as allowing a variety of perspectives of a physical object and superimposing digital environment</p>
<section id="ar" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ar">AR</h3>
<p>The next generation of advanced technologies for learning include many different kinds of mixed reality (MR) applications. These immersive technologies hallow for increased immersion into novel topics and concepts and new ways for students to interact with three-dimensional objects and physical spaces. Due to the ubiquitous nature of computing, AR has increasingly become more affordable compared to other immersive digital environments like VR.Additionally, AR has shown the potential to enable individuals construct new understanding by overlaying digital displays over real-world environmentsand looking at a variety of perspectives<span class="citation" data-cites="yoonHowAugmentedReality2020">(<a href="#ref-yoonHowAugmentedReality2020" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>yoonHowAugmentedReality2020?</strong></a>)</span>. By doing that , these AR experiences can help users inquire and explore aspects of a virtual world in more concrete ways that might not be possible in a naturalistic setting <span class="citation" data-cites="yoonHowAugmentedReality2020">(<a href="#ref-yoonHowAugmentedReality2020" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>yoonHowAugmentedReality2020?</strong></a>)</span>. AR has specific affordances in education research that can be applied to difficult concepts or scientific phenomena that cant be showed in a natural classroom. These affordances may include: scientific spatial ability(manipulating objects and content in a 3D space); engaging in scientific inquiry through the use of observations, questions, group collaboration, investigations and interpreting data; increased concpetual understanding of abstract concepts and invisible phenomena. <!--# need to cite dunleavy & dede 2014; cheng and tsai 2013; wu et al 2013 --> These are example affordances that can be used with AR to align instructional material with classroom learning goals such as allowing students to work together in pairs or small groups with a shared virtual object projected into their normal classroom space.</p>
<p>In science education specifically, AR provides rich opportunities to motivate students by utilizing physical and digital objects that can create novel learning experiences for students.&nbsp;AR also provides opportunities for distance learning in classrooms, which can reduce chances of students missing out on collaborative learning environments. In <span class="citation" data-cites="dunleavyAffordancesLimitationsImmersive2009">(<a href="#ref-dunleavyAffordancesLimitationsImmersive2009" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>dunleavyAffordancesLimitationsImmersive2009?</strong></a>)</span>, researchers studied student interactions in Alien Contact!. This project combined physical and digital artifacts through the use of a handheld device, which required students to interact with these digital objects to inquire about mathematics, literacy and science understanding. Dunleavy 2009, is a good example of leveraging AR affordances to foster science understanding &amp; engagement with instructional content in a shared virtual/physical space. &nbsp;</p>

<section id="scale" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="scale">Scale</h3>
<p>Scale, proportion &amp; quantity is an important area in science &amp; engineering that is fundamental to how students make observations and relationships in nature. Its critical for students to be able to distinguiqsh relative differences in size, time and energy scales and the ability to understand the proportional relationships in those quantities as the scales begin to change. This is just one example in science education of a cross cutting concept that educators and learners have struggles with in the classroom. Crosscutting concepts(CCC’s) are important for students to make connections across domains and situations while also connecting the content to their prior experiences which can provide deeper engagement within the learning material. Previous research on CCC’s has looked at difficulties instructors face with integrating coursework that is well aligned with the curriculum and any difficulties students face in understanding science concepts with traditional materials <!--# cite harris et al 2015 & Hogan 2015)  -->.</p>
<p>In science education, scale is important across domains such as astronomy and chemistry, where it is important to understand relative sizes and distances of observable and non observable artifacts. An example of this could be introducing an AR environment to&nbsp;&nbsp;help students with seeing and understanding scale in different ways than can be traditionally&nbsp; observed in a classroom environment.&nbsp; The artifacts under investigation can be manipulated in different ways, including size and scale, allowing different viewpoints by walking around a virtual artifact and comparing it with real objects.&nbsp;</p>
<del>
Current literature on scale understanding is focusing on VR simulations to help students navigate inaccurate understandings about size and scale. In science education, scale is important across domains such as astronomy and chemistry, where it is important to understand the relative sizes and distances of observable and non-observable artifacts at the extremes of scale.

<section id="scale-is-hard-to-teachlearn" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="scale-is-hard-to-teachlearn">Scale is hard to teach/learn</h3>
<p>The cross cutting concept(CCC’s) of scale, proportion and quantity is one of several&nbsp; CCC’s that is part of the new vision for k-12 science education (NRC, 2012). Scale is defined as&nbsp; “a system of measurement that allows for the comparison of relative sizes”&nbsp;(Delgado et al ., 2007) these systems of measurement can include weight, time, temperature and other variables that can be assessed and estimated. Existing</p>
<p>In STEAM, understanding the concept of scale <strong>is crucial to understanding relationships</strong>.&nbsp; Scale is particularly important in science disciplines such as astronomy, where spatial scale is important for students to understand the relative sizes, volumes, and distances of objects in the solar system and beyond. Scale is also important across the disciplines of geology (eg., geological time scales) and chemistry (eg., molecular and atomic scales) all have substantive concepts that involve issues at the extremes of scale&nbsp;</p>
<p>While accurate measurement when quantifying known phenomena is highly important in the sciences, students have issues understanding scale (Jones et al., 2017)across different scientific domains. For my research, I am focused on students’ understanding of the extremes of scale. Jones et al (2017) highlighted that students’ ability to conceive of scale is limited by their age, education, and maturity(difficulties with objects beyond human scale).</p>
<p>When the context of scale is applied to the size of objects, young learners struggle to comprehend objects beyond the human scale (their own body) but can improve as they get older. For objects larger than human scale, young learners’ conceptual ideas of objects “larger than them” can be the size of a school bus or minivan (Jones et al., 2017). As students get older (ie., high school students), their conceptual benchmark of larger units grows to larger objects like shopping malls or a football field (Ibid.) In the other direction, young learners have a very broad understanding of smaller objects —- an ant or a fly might be the smallest thing they can conceptualize; older students can conceptualize objects at the microscopic level like blood cells or complex molecules (Tretter et al., 2006). For students to conceptualize scale they need a deeper understanding of the relative sizes of objects and entities at the extremes (bigger or smaller) which can be leveraged using the existing affordances of AR (eg., limited immersion) embodied learning activities within an AR simulation.</p>

<section id="ar-and-collaborative-learning" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ar-and-collaborative-learning">AR and Collaborative Learning</h3>
<p>In the learning process. In research, collaborative learning is categorized as ” A instructional use of small groups for students to work together to maximize learning” (Johnson et al., 1990) &nbsp; Collaborative learning is accomplished through students working in groups while trying to mutually understand solutions, meanings or creating artifacts(Lin 2015). In contrast, individual learning is the more traditional learning that has occurred in classrooms throughout history, where classroom content, instructional content and learning pace are entirely based on a students ability and interest to increase knowledge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are significant differences between collaborative and individual learning.&nbsp; Collaborative learning requires students&nbsp; and teachers to partake in social interactions, transferring of ideas and intergroup dynamics, which can be more advantageous over individual learning.&nbsp; An example of this is Problem-based learning(PBL), a form of collaborative learning that utilizes&nbsp; a student-centered approach so students can learn and interact in groups about a subject and solve complex open-ended problems. PBL is&nbsp; commonly used in teaching medical students how to solve problems in a clinical setting, but is often being implemented in K-12 Education to help instructors facilitate student problem-solving and self-directed learning skills(Barrows &amp; Kelson 1993).&nbsp; PBL highlights a distinct difference between individual learning and collaboration, which is the role of the teacher. In problem-based learning teachers are often facilitating and fostering discussions in the classroom, as opposed to simply lecturing and assigning individual tasks for students. PBL, which is based on situated learning&nbsp; is based on the idea that learning is effective when it is ingrained in learning that is anchored in everyday context(Hung et al ., 2008)</p>
<p>Augmented reality can be helpful in supporting collaborative learning, through the creation of immersed hybrid learning environments that combine real and virtual objects. As a result, AR can help facilitate problem solving, critical thinking and communication through collaborative learning activities. Within an educational context, AR can help support collaborative learning by allowing students to simulate training medical students(Hanna et al., 2018), or by allowing students to understand abstract science concepts like molecular structures(Bonete et al ., 2019).Augmented reality can help facilitate a community of learners by&nbsp; integrating positive interdependent learning by giving students different or incomplete data that require group collaboration to solve a problem(Squire &amp; Kloper, 2007). Integrating AR within the course curriculum can help science understanding, by allowing instructors to better&nbsp; specific science phenomena, and allow students to interact with physical objects that can display contextual information, and allow students to manipulate objects in a 3-dimensional space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instructors face several challenges when implementing AR technology in collaborative spaces. As previously mentioned, instructors cannot simply adopt technology in the classroom without additional support and training.&nbsp; Successfully implementing AR technology in the classroom requires a knowledgeable instructor to properly introduce and facilitate these collaborative explorations, which may require multiple facilitators&nbsp; if technical errors may occur. There is a need to create teacher materials to support implementing technology in the classroom while also finding ways to integrate other parts of the curriculum that the teacher is already using. With the goal of using AR as an effective learning tool in the classroom, there is a need to scaffold student exploration and 3-d object manipulation that is based on clear parameters so that learning goals can be achieved in a short period of time. In addition to the creation of learning materials for teachers, there is a need for designers and educators to be less focused on what students are seeing in the application and more about the manipulations the students are doing within the application and how the students have learned from it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are also practical and logistical challenges of implementing AR technology in the classroom, depending on the type of AR hardware being used, which can be cost prohibitive for schools to implement, manage and debug issues, which can pile increasing demands on teachers and administrators.&nbsp; In regards to student learning, there are challenges relating to cognitive overload (Dunleavy et al., 2009) where students can feel overwhelmed if constructed environments and exercises are too complex. Managing the level of complexity for learners is a challenge that requires researchers to create a simple and dynamic learning experience; ability to scaffold experiences and limiting AR interactions by students(Squire &amp; Kloper, 2007; O’shea et a., 2009).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another limitation of AR technology in the classroom is practicality. There are challenges in integration and managing this technology for researchers &amp; instructors, but there are also institutional challenges.&nbsp; AR technology is often best applied in student joint exploration, inquiry-based activities and informal learning, which can be different from standards-driven context of school systems. AR collaborative learning environments are time consuming and can be difficult to manage, and may often transfer to achievement or assessment testing metrics.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>
## Current space of science education within AR for k-12 learners</p>
<p>In extant literature, educational researchers have been creating inclusive field trips using augmented or virtual reality (Gilley et al., 2015). In a study with environmental science, Kamarainen and colleagues integrated AR technology water measurement equipment (using the Texas Instrument Nspire) and the FreshAiR augmented reality mobile application. The project “EcoMOBILE”, students utilize their mobile device and water measurement device to collect water samples during a field trip. In this mixed-methods research design, researchers assessed students’ self-efficacy on their ecological science knowledge, and tasks they completed during the field trip. Results from their study found that students showed an increased ability in understanding of how to complete science related tasks &amp; understanding focal topics (Kamarainen et al., 2013). By combining AR technology with scientific measuring equipment and creating meaningful activities, students are provided with meaningful context in a field trip experience (Kamarainen et al., 2013).</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="research-designplan">Research Design/Plan</h3>
<p>This research proposal aims to design and support AR collaborative learning experiences for middle-school students that engages them in the crosscutting concept of scale across different science domains. This project will employ a design-based research approach (dbr cite), which includes an iterative cycle of design, development, testing and refinement with input from instructors and students. Researchers and instructors will also iterate on supportive materials for teachers to best foster science discussion in the classroom using our learning technology (AR science activity).</p>
<p>As a secondary design principle, we will iterate on the design of this application using the Learning through Embodied Activity Framework (LEAF)[@danishLearningEmbodiedActivity2020] to guide our science learning activity design. LEAF framework provides researchers educators tools for designing mixed reality learning experience, by looking at the roles of the student, teacher and collective groups within the activity itself. This framework will help us create activities that better grounds an embodied activity in the requisite learning goals for instructors and learners, while also highlighting different dimensions of an embodied activity (eg., individual and collective experiences for students and instructors).</p>
<!--# This could use some work -->
<p>Aligning to the below NGSS performance expectations will increase the likelihood that teachers will eventually be able to easily integrate the activities into their normal curricular materials and plans.</p>

<p>In these activities students will be learning about scale in a variety of different contexts around the concept of size and scale (possibly maps and models) to help conceptualize relationships between objects and phenomena in a naturalistic (classroom?)setting. They two concepts students will be learning about will be relative size differences of objects by looking at relating to planets and stars in our local solar system, Additionally in another activity students will create scale models of physical objects that represent atoms and molecules of different sizes (microscopic).</p>
<p>These activities will be Three collaborative sessions spanning 30 minutes each in an after school lab sessions at CRC(our lab). In this activity students will collaboratively create scale models <!--# of what --> and be introduced to science simulations <!--# which -->. In the first activity, students will be introduced to planets within our solar system (8?) within an AR environment (mobile tablet with AR app) where students will be able to explore different planets and planetary distances. Students will be working in pairs or small groups and given a mobile device with the AR app installed. In small groups students will explore the solar system, focusing on the scale of the planets(relative size differences between them) and the distances between these objects within our solar system. Students will be able to use gestures to compare these relative sizes while also creating shared annotations about their observations and questions they might have about the planets in this activity (such as the diameter of the moon compared to the earth and how they might visualize/interpret this). These gestures include options to observe the objects from different viewpoints and location, while also allowing them to measure distances between planets <!--# this can lead to a discussion about shapes of planents and types of orbit (such as earth having a circular orbit and the other types of orbits)  -->. <!--# not sure if i want to touch time scales or a time scrubber just yet  -->Students will also have additional physical artifacts that can be overlayed in the app to make further comparisons of objects at different scales(macroscopic, microscopic and molecular scale) to better observe an otherwise invisible phenomena <!--# need to work on this sentence  --></p>
<p>Second activity:</p>
<p>In this activity students will be exploring simple and complex molecules and their structures (creating models of structures) to better understand molecular scale. (For example the sun is 7-8% helium and the rest hydrogen)</p>
